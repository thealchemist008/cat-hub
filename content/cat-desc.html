    <h3>About Cats</h3>
    <h4>General Information</h4>
    <p>The <strong>cat</strong> (<em>Felis catus</em>) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.<br>
       It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to<br>
       as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.<br>
       A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely<br>
       and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and<br>
       their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Lineage of Cats</h4>
    <p>Studies suggest that there have been two lineages of cats. One lineage appeared in Asia Minor<br>
       as early as 6,400 years ago, dispersing northward and westward into Europe. The other lineage<br>
       appeared in Egypt between 6,400 and 1,000 years ago before spreading throughout the Mediterranean.<br> 
       Both lineages continued to breed with the African wildcat during their respective dispersals.<br>
